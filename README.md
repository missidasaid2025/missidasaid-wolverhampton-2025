Miss Ida said Doctors have no common sense
It sounds like Miss Ida had quite a strong opinion about doctors! Without more context, it's hard to understand her reasoning. Sometimes people have specific experiences that shape their views, but it's important to remember that many doctors work very hard and have extensive training to help people.
I am sure that you have more details about what led to Miss Ida's comment?
Miss Ida said Doctors have lots of book sense but no common sense, because common sense is not thought at university. it is learnt in the school of life.
Miss Ida makes an interesting point. There’s certainly a distinction between academic knowledge and practical, everyday wisdom. While doctors are trained rigorously in medical school, some might argue that common sense, or practical judgement, comes from diverse life experiences outside of formal education.
It’s a balance, really. Medical professionals need their "book sense" to diagnose and treat conditions accurately, but common sense helps them navigate real-world scenarios and connect with patients on a human level.
I am sure we all had experiences where this distinction stood out?
